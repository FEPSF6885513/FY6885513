            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, is revolutionizing manufacturing by offering unmatched flexibility, efficiency, and design freedom. Unlike traditional subtractive methods, AM builds components layer by layer, reducing material waste and allowing for intricate designs that were previously impossible or cost-prohibitive. This paper explores AM's transformative impact on industries, from prototyping to end-use production, with notable applications in aerospace and biomedical fields. Despite its advantages, including rapid customization and cost savings, challenges such as material limitations, scaling for mass production, and skilled labor remain. The paper concludes that AM will not entirely replace conventional manufacturing but will instead complement it through hybrid approaches. By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, industries can create smarter, more sustainable production systems, paving the way for innovative solutions in manufacturing.</p>

            <p id="Section1">In the past few decades, innovations in material sciences have surpassed expectations, but manufacturing methods haven’t kept pace. We’re still stuck with conventional subtractive production techniques that waste materials and lack efficiency. This is where Additive Manufacturing (AM) steps in, offering solutions like reduced material waste, the ability to quickly modify designs, and seamless integration of changes into production lines.</p>
            <p id="Section2">AM in a broad context is simply a means of creating an object by adding material often in layers to achieve a final geometry, the most common of which is by far 3D printing, Where a range of materials (Polymers, metals, resins, and many others) are built up one layer at a time.</p>
            <p id="Section3">Milling has been the backbone of manufacturing for a long time. Even with advancements like 5-axis machining, the basic approach has stayed the same since its origins back when designs were done on paper.</p>
            <p id="Section4">AM’s potential goes beyond just improving manufacturing; it’s also changing how we design. With no constraints like tool paths or accessibility, designers can focus on optimization, efficiency, and simplifying assemblies.</p>
            <p id="Section5">Despite all the benefits, AM still has a big hurdle: materials. In the early days, and even now with entry-level machines, the materials weren’t strong enough for most practical uses. The range of materials was limited, and post-processing requirements were high.</p>
            <p id="Section6">Across industries, AM has become a go-to for prototyping. It’s fast, cost-effective, and perfect for testing designs quickly. Companies like General Electric are leading the way, showing that AM can also be used for end-use parts, like engine components and mechanisms ready for deployment.</p>
            <p id="Section7">Even with all its advantages, AM isn’t without challenges. Scaling up for mass production is still tricky, materials need further innovation, the machines themselves need to be optimized for repeated part production, and there’s a growing need for trained workers to handle AM processes.</p>
