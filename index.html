            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p id="Introduction_InText">Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, is revolutionizing manufacturing by offering unmatched flexibility,
                efficiency, and design freedom. Unlike traditional subtractive methods, AM builds components layer by layer, reducing material waste 
                and allowing for intricate designs that were previously impossible or cost-prohibitive. This paper explores AM's transformative impact 
                on industries, from prototyping to end-use production, with notable applications in aerospace and biomedical fields. Despite its advantages, 
                including rapid customization and cost savings, challenges such as material limitations, scaling for mass production, and skilled labor remain.
                The paper concludes that AM will not entirely replace conventional manufacturing but will instead complement it through hybrid approaches. 
                By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, industries can create smarter, more sustainable production systems, 
                paving the way for innovative solutions in manufacturing.</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">In the past few decades, innovations in material sciences have surpassed expectations,
                but manufacturing methods haven’t kept pace. We’re still stuck with conventional subtractive production techniques that waste materials and lack efficiency.
                This is where Additive Manufacturing (AM) steps in, offering solutions like reduced material waste, the ability to quickly modify designs, and seamless integration of changes into production lines.
                While AM has its roots in the late 20th century, it’s only in the past decade that it’s become practical and accessible. Affordable machines for hobbyists and industry-grade systems have brought AM into the spotlight, 
                from prototyping to actual production. This article looks at how AM is reshaping manufacturing and compares it to the older, more traditional methods <a href="#Gebhardt">(Gebhardt, A.2019).</a>

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">AM in a broad contex is simply a means of creating an object by adding material ofen in layers to achieve a final geometry, the most common of which is by far 3D printing,
                 Where a range of materials(Polymers, metals, resins and many others) are built up one layer at a time. </p>

        <section id="TradLimits">
            <h2>Traditional Manufacturing and its Limitations</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">Milling has been the backbone of manufacturing for a long time. Even with advancements like 5-axis machining, the basic approach has stayed the same since its origins back when designs were done on paper.
                This is a stark contrast to today, where tools like 3D CAD and CAM software dominate. These tools naturally fit better with AM, but traditional machining still faces major limitations. Things like undercuts, internal features, tool size, and accessibility can constrain designs.
                 Engineers have had to work within these limits for years <a href="#GPT">(ChatGPT, 2024).</a> AM, on the other hand, removes these barriers, allowing for much more freedom in design.

        <section id="DesignLanguage">
            <h2>Change of Design Language and Manufacturing Intent</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">AM’s potential goes beyond just improving manufacturing; it’s also changing how we design. 
                With no constraints like tool paths or accessibility, designers can focus on optimization, efficiency, and simplifying assemblies.
                Complexity in AM doesn’t add costs. Features or intricate details that would need multiple setups or tool changes with traditional methods can now be included at no extra effort. 
                This is a game-changer, making it possible to create better, more competitive products. Advantages like compliant mechanisms, 
                reduced part counts, and simplified assemblies, improve efficiency without increasing production time <a href="#Duda">(Duda and Raghavan, 2018).</a>

        <section id="LimitingFactor">
            <h2>The Limiting Factor</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">Despite all the benefits, AM still has a big hurdle: materials. In the early days, and even now with entry-level machines, the materials weren’t strong enough for most practical uses. The range of materials was limited, and post-processing requirements were high.
                Thankfully, advancements in machine efficiency and material science are changing this. 
                Modern systems are now producing parts that need minimal finishing and meet strength and durability requirements,
                 matching or even surpassing what traditional methods can achieve <a href="#Shi">(Shi, 2021)</a>.

        <section id="UsePeroduction">
            <h2>Widespread Use and Advancements in Production</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">Across industries, AM has become a go-to for prototyping. It’s fast, cost-effective, and perfect for testing designs quickly.
                 Companies like General Electric are leading the way, showing that AM can also be used for end-use parts, 
                 like engine components and mechanisms ready for deployment <a href="#Sheng">(Sheng, 2022).</a></p>

            <p id="Analysis_InText">
                This ability to streamline development while staying flexible makes AM invaluable, 
                especially in industries that require rapid iterations or custom solutions.

        <section id="Future">
            <h2>Challenges and Future Outlook</h2>
            <p id="Analysis_InText">
                Even with all its advantages, AM isn’t without challenges. Scaling up for mass production is still tricky,
                 materials need further innovation, the machines themselves need to be optimized for repeated part production and there’s a growing need for trained workers to handle AM processes.
                  This though, isn’t a homogeneous standard, many industries still rely on traditional methods of manufacturing for reliability and familiarity.</p>
                <p>That said, AM is still advancing at a rapid pace. It’s excelling in areas like specialized and custom production, such as prosthetics in the medical field, custom applications in motorsports, the space industy ,
                 and various other specialized fields <a href="#Sheng">(Sheng, 2022)</a>.
                  The future will likely see AM and traditional manufacturing methods working together,
                   combining the best of both worlds to create smarter and more efficient production systems, 
                   harnessing Traditinal methods to achieve a GD&T’s.<a href="#Strong">(Strong, 2018)</a>
