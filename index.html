            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, is revolutionizing manufacturing by offering unmatched flexibility,
                efficiency, and design freedom. Unlike traditional subtractive methods, AM builds components layer by layer, reducing material waste 
                and allowing for intricate designs that were previously impossible or cost-prohibitive. This paper explores AM's transformative impact 
                on industries, from prototyping to end-use production, with notable applications in aerospace and biomedical fields. Despite its advantages, 
                including rapid customization and cost savings, challenges such as material limitations, scaling for mass production, and skilled labor remain.
                The paper concludes that AM will not entirely replace conventional manufacturing but will instead complement it through hybrid approaches. 
                By leveraging the strengths of both technologies, industries can create smarter, more sustainable production systems, 
                paving the way for innovative solutions in manufacturing.</p>

        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the past few decades, innovations in material sciences have surpassed expectations,
                but manufacturing methods haven’t kept pace. We’re still stuck with conventional subtractive production techniques that waste materials and lack efficiency.
                This is where Additive Manufacturing (AM) steps in, offering solutions like reduced material waste, the ability to quickly modify designs, and seamless integration of changes into production lines.
                While AM has its roots in the late 20th century, it’s only in the past decade that it’s become practical and accessible. Affordable machines for hobbyists and industry-grade systems have brought AM into the spotlight, 
                from prototyping to actual production. This article looks at how AM is reshaping manufacturing and compares it to the older, more traditional methods (Gebhardt, A.2019).

        <section id="how-it-works">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>AM broadly refers to creating objects by adding material in layers to achieve a final geometry. The most common example is 
            3D printing, which uses materials such as polymers, metals, and resins. A CAD model is transformed into a physical object, layer by layer.</p>

        <section id="analysis">
            <h2>Analysis & Discussion</h2>
            <p>Traditional manufacturing methods like milling face limitations, such as tool accessibility and design constraints. AM 
            removes these barriers, allowing for greater design freedom and cost-effective complexity. Designers can focus on optimization 
            without additional production costs, simplifying assemblies and creating more competitive products.</p>

        <section id="custom-production">
            <h2>Custom Production</h2>
            <p>AM excels in custom manufacturing, particularly in the biomedical sector, where it revolutionizes prosthetics and implants. 
            This process reduces costs, production times, and tooling requirements while enabling rapid adjustments through reprinting.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h2>Challenges & Outlook</h2>
            <p>Despite its advantages, AM faces hurdles like scaling for mass production, material innovation, and machine optimization for 
            repeatability. However, advancements in material sciences and manufacturing techniques are addressing these challenges, making 
            AM increasingly viable for end-use production.</p>
